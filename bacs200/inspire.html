<h1>Inspiration Page</h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Picture this &mdash; a seemingly endless sheet of ice, a loud scratch of the ice, then magic. Jason Brown, a now Olympic figure skater, was right in front of me doing a triple axle jump at the ice rink my sister had been training at.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had learned to skate at a young age of 5 but stopped a few years later. However, once seeing Jason take off with such ease, grace, athleticism, it inspired me to skate again. I soon watched him then in events all around the world, from France to Japan and everywhere in between. And now I&rsquo;m skating 10 years later while at the University of Northern Colorado. </span></p>
<p class="c0 c2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is an extremely friendly and humble person. You&rsquo;d never know he was an Olympic skater just talking with him. He&rsquo;s your typical 20 something year old, who had been going to college in Colorado Springs at UCCS, the University of Colorado Springs, Colorado.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What makes him unique is his dedication to keep going even though times can be tough. Jason is one of the few Olympic skaters who hasn&rsquo;t been able to do a quad jump. But, due to his extreme artistic ability he&rsquo;s still been able to score near the top of the pack. He&rsquo;s still trying to land the quad and everyone keeps telling him he&rsquo;ll never make it. But, I have seen him land it. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time before he adds it to his arsenal. With his artistic ability, determination, athleticism, and then added to the quad, he would be unstoppable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jason is someone whom I look up to, and someone who inspires me. I can only hope that one day I can achieve greatness, or even a portion of what Jason&rsquo;s achieved. (I&rsquo;m on the left at a young age of ~10 :) )</span></p>
