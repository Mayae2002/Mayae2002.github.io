About me

My name is Maya Eaton and I'm currently attending the University of Northern Colorado, UNC. I'm majoring in Business with emphasis in 
marketing with hopes to someday own my own business, specifically a Radiology business. 

At a relatively young age to be thinking about the rest of my life of around 13, a family friend was talking with me who had suggested I get into 
business since he has had really good success with it. And on top of that he said, your grandfather was a business man too. In addition
to being a business owner, Tanweer, is also a doctor -- specifically a radiologist. 

So, that's where the owning a Radiology business comes in. Tanweer has since sold his portion of the business and has retired at 
a young age of around 55. But, he has inspired me, and while going to UNC is but a stepping stone in the grand scheme of things,
it is a giant leap towards the rest of my life.

In addition to being interested in business, I love figure skating (you can read about this in my inspiration page). Also, I love computers
probably due to my father having been in the computer industry designing pieces of them for years now.  Aside from that, I really enjoy bhanga
dancing. I am a quarter Pakistani (My grandpad is from Pakistan). So, because of that influence I decided to learn bhanga. 

I had hoped to join the Colorado Bhanga dance team this last year but unfortunately Covid took precidence and practices had been delayed.
But hopefully this year, I'll be able to get back to it.

All in all though, I'm just a happy, life loving person who tries to make those around me happy too.
